# Pokemon Catcher

A web application for Pokémon enthusiasts who want to look up Pokémon and create their own personal collection.

If you were one of those kids in elementary school who had trading cards or had a Pokemon game, you were automatically considered a cool kid. Growing up, my parents didn't let me have such things so naturally, I was jealous. Now that I'm an adult, I can now design the Pokemon experience that I missed out on growing up.
